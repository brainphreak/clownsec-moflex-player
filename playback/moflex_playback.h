/* Reusable native moflex (MobiClip 3D video + IMA-ADPCM audio) player.
 *
 * Drop-in: one call plays a .moflex to the top screen in stereoscopic 3D with
 * audio, returning when the file ends or the user backs out.
 *
 * Caller requirements (do these ONCE at app startup, not per file):
 *   gfxInitDefault();
 *   ndspInit();            // if you want audio; moflex_play uses channel 0
 * moflex_play() sets the top screen to RGB565 + enables 3D itself.
